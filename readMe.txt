To run my project
http://localhost:8080/UberEats/order.html

 
First it shows main page which is order.html, you select mcdonalds and add any items you want and click on the cart which takes you to the login page which asks for the user name and password if you are registered only then can you order. If you are registered and forot password i check from the database if person exists and send one auto generated password to user gmail account. Then you enter your address and confirm order which takes you to the reciept page and you can browse your orders which displays order date and necessary information.

My project sends email to the password if user forgot the password
provided that user exists. My application also check if user is there or not. If there is no user then my app will send them them to register page. 
Updating cart when user adds any item and you click over the cart to move on next page. There is addition of error page in app when any thing goes wrong. Making beans and jsps. 
There is also addition of reciept page and one confirm page.

My custom tag is formatting the money.
